def resolve_escapes_root(file_path: str) -> tuple[bool, str]:
    """
    Detect a "GhostApproval" symlink escape: a ``file_path`` that *lexically*
    looks like it targets a location inside the project root, but — once
    symlinks are followed — actually lands OUTSIDE it.

    That deception is the threat (a Write/Edit to a local-looking path such as
    ``.claude/settings.json`` that is really a symlink to ``~/.ssh/...``).
    Callers must run this check unconditionally — BEFORE any
    security-profile-based enable/disable gate — and treat a truthy first
    return value as an unconditional block, regardless of profile.

    An *explicitly* out-of-root target — a path that is already outside the
    project lexically (a scratchpad under /tmp, a sibling repo reached via
    ``..``, ``~/.claude/...``) — is NOT a symlink deception. It is a
    deliberate write and is allowed here, so legitimate out-of-tree work
    (scratchpad, cross-repo edits, memory) is not broken. Normal
    tool-permission gating still applies to such writes elsewhere.

    Decision — block iff BOTH hold: (1) the write, following every symlink,
    lands OUTSIDE the root, AND (2) the path lexically CLAIMS to be inside the
    root (some ancestor directory of its lexical form IS the root). A path that
    lands INSIDE the root is safe even if it passed through a symlink ABOVE the
    root (e.g. /tmp -> /private/tmp).

    Containment is decided by inode identity (``os.path.samefile``), NOT string
    comparison: macOS APFS is case-INSENSITIVE, so a re-cased root prefix
    (``Forge-Framework`` vs ``forge-framework``) and a symlinked ancestor
    (``/tmp`` vs ``/private/tmp``) name the SAME directory and must be treated
    as such, or the guard is trivially bypassed by re-casing/re-spelling.

    Fails CLOSED (block) on: a NUL byte in the path; an unreachable project
    root; or a path that raises while being resolved. A plain symlink loop or
    over-long path that ``realpath`` merely swallows (returning an in-root
    path) is allowed — it stays in-root and the write fails on its own; it is
    not an escape. HARDLINKS cannot be caught by any path-based check (a
    hardlink alias inside root shares an outside file's inode but has no
    distinguishing path) — an inherent limitation, out of scope here.

    Returns (True, reason) to block, (False, "") to allow.
