Smart Capability Gap Validator (P33)

Validates capability gap proposals before creating hiring recommendations.
Prevents false positives by:
1. Checking if capability already exists in an employee
2. Filtering evidence to only gaps where the specific capability was missing
3. Recommending capability expansion over hiring when appropriate

Usage:
    from capability_gap_validator import validate_capability_proposal

    result = validate_capability_proposal("shell-scripting", gap_summary)
    if not result.is_valid:
        print(f"Auto-rejected: {result.auto_reject_reason}")
