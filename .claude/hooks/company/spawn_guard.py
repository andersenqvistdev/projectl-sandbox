"""Machine-level guard against real Claude CLI spawns from test contexts.

2026-07-06 incident: running pytest on test_operation_loop.py reached the real
Agent Teams path through a function-local import that module-attribute mocks
cannot see. Each affected test spawned a real team of `claude` workers, and the
spawned workers — allowed to run pytest themselves — re-triggered the leaky
tests recursively. 774 real claude sessions were created in ~65 minutes (368
alive simultaneously, ~160GB RSS); the storm only stopped when the Claude
subscription window was exhausted. No Forge safety applied: worker caps and
circuit breakers only guard the daemon's own spawn paths.

This module is the hard stop for that entire failure class. Every call site
that launches the Claude CLI calls assert_spawn_allowed() with the exact
subprocess primitive it is about to use:

    assert_spawn_allowed("team_executor._run_team_in", subprocess.run)

Behavior:
- If the primitive is not the real subprocess function (a test installed a
  Mock or monkeypatch double), the spawn is allowed — properly mocked tests
  are unaffected and need no changes.
- If the primitive is real and this process is inside a pytest run ("pytest"
  in sys.modules), SpawnBlockedError is raised.
- If the primitive is real and PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST is present in the
  environment, SpawnBlockedError is raised too. pytest sets that variable for
  every test and child processes inherit it (the worker env filtering only
  strips UV_/CLAUDECODE/CLAUDE_CODE_ prefixes), so even a worker leaked BY a
  test cannot spawn further workers — this breaks the recursive amplification.
- FORGE_ALLOW_REAL_SPAWN_IN_TESTS=1 bypasses the guard, for deliberate
  integration tests only.
