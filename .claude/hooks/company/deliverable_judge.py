Deliverable Judge — single-PR pre-merge "does the diff address the task?" gate.

Phase 2 of the autonomy plan (.planning/autonomy/phase-2-premerge-deliverable-gate.md).

CI proves a diff is *safe*, not that it *does what the task asked*. The Tier-2
semantic judge (`.claude/workflows/calibrate.js`) catches the phantom-merge class
(e.g. #1012 — re-documented an already-documented function) but today only weeks
later as an AUDIT. This module promotes that exact adversarial check to a
PRE-MERGE GATE: given one (task_id, title, description, pr_number) it asks a
skeptical judge whether the PR's diff substantively addresses the task.

Design invariants (see the phase-2 spec):
  * Reuse calibrate.js's adversarial framing + decision rule + schema. The shared
    sentences live in the constants below and a regression test
    (tests/test_deliverable_judge.py) asserts they appear verbatim in calibrate.js,
    so the two stay one source of truth even though the JS workflow sandbox cannot
    import this module.
  * Fail-CLOSED-to-REVIEW. Judge errors / rate-limits / unparseable output =>
    blocked + needs-manual-review. NEVER auto-reject and NEVER auto-close the work
    on a judge failure (we have repeatedly fought auto-close levers — see MEMORY).
  * Additive. This composes with the existing allowMergeToMain / human-approval
    auto-merge gates; it never creates a path that bypasses them.
  * Cost-aware. One agent per PR, gated to daemon/* (and forge/*) branches only,
    and the verdict is cached by the PR head commit sha so re-polls / CI re-runs
    do not re-call the LLM.

The gate bites in two places:
  1. The daemon Python path (pr_output_manager.execute_auto_pr_workflow) runs the
     judge right after creating a daemon PR and, on a block verdict, applies the
     ``needs-manual-review`` label + posts the reason as a PR comment via
     pr_output_manager.apply_manual_review_label, which also disarms any
     already-armed GitHub native auto-merge (``gh pr merge --disable-auto``) — a
     label alone cannot stop an armed merge (PR #248).
  2. ci.yml's auto-merge job refuses to enable auto-merge on any daemon PR that
     carries ``needs-manual-review`` — so the label set here closes the real
     (CI) auto-merge lever too — and also disarms early on every run if the
     label is already present, for the same reason.

Usage:
    python deliverable_judge.py judge --task-id T --pr-number 123 \
        --title "..." --description "..."
