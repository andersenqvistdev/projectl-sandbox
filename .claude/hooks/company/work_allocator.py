Pull-Based Work Allocator — queue-based task assignment for company agents.

Implements a pull-based work allocation system where agents request work
rather than being assigned work. Uses file-based locking for safe
concurrent access.

Work Queue Schema (work_queue.json):
- pending: Tasks ready for assignment
- in_progress: Tasks currently being worked on
- blocked: Tasks waiting on dependencies
- completed: Finished tasks (for audit trail)

Task Schema:
{
    "task_id": "unique-task-id",
    "priority": 1-4 (1=Critical, 2=High, 3=Normal, 4=Low),
    "required_capabilities": ["capability1", "capability2"],
    "department": "department_id",
    "project_id": "project-identifier or null",
    "created_at": "ISO timestamp",
    "deadline": "ISO timestamp or null",
    "estimated_complexity": "trivial|standard|complex|epic",
    "dependencies_satisfied": true/false,
    "dependencies": ["task-id-1", "task-id-2"],
    "title": "Task title",
    "description": "Task description",
    "source": "human|self|escalation|planning",
    "assigned_to": "agent_id or null",
    "assigned_at": "ISO timestamp or null",
    "created_by": "employee_id or null"
}

Source Types:
    human = Human-directed work (explicit user request)
    self = Self-generated work (agent autonomy)
    escalation = Escalated from another agent
    planning = Generated during planning phase

Priority Levels:
    1 = Critical (system down, security issues)
    2 = High (urgent features, major bugs)
    3 = Normal (standard development work)
    4 = Low (nice-to-have, refactoring)

Usage:
    # Add a new task to the queue
    python work_allocator.py add --title "Task" --priority 2 --department eng

    # Agent pulls next available task
    python work_allocator.py pull --agent-id "agent-001" --capabilities "code,review"

    # Update task status
    python work_allocator.py update --task-id "task-123" --status completed

    # List queue status
    python work_allocator.py list [--status pending|in_progress|blocked]

    # Check agent workload
    python work_allocator.py workload --agent-id "agent-001"
