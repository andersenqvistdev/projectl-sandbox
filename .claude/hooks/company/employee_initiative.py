Employee Initiative Module — P26 Task 26.4

Enables employees to propose work independently based on:
- TODO/FIXME comments discovered in the codebase
- Code quality improvements
- Follow-up tasks from recently completed work
- Research findings

This module empowers the organization to be self-improving, not just
top-down directed. Employees can identify and propose valuable work
that managers then review and approve.

Usage:
    # Generate proposals for an employee
    python employee_initiative.py propose --employee-id "senior-python-developer"

    # Scan for TODOs matching employee capabilities
    python employee_initiative.py scan-todos --employee-id "senior-python-developer"

    # Generate follow-up proposals from recent work
    python employee_initiative.py follow-ups --employee-id "senior-python-developer"

    # Get initiative stats
    python employee_initiative.py stats
