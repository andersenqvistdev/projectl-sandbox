Employee Pool Manager — cross-project employee sharing via org.json.

This module wraps org.json for employee pool management. It does NOT create
separate state — all reads/writes go through org.json.

Functions:
    get_available_employees(project_id, capabilities) -> list
        Query employees with project access and optional capability filter.

    assign_employee_to_project(employee_id, project_id) -> dict
        Update org.json employees[].projectAssignments array.

    get_employee_project_load() -> dict
        Return employee_id -> count of assigned projects from org.json.

    suggest_employee_for_task(task) -> dict
        Match task required_capabilities to employee capabilities.

    balance_employee_load() -> list[dict]
        Identify overloaded/underutilized employees and suggest rebalancing.

Usage:
    # Get available employees for a project
    python employee_pool.py available --project-id proj-123 --capabilities "python,testing"

    # Assign an employee to a project
    python employee_pool.py assign --employee-id dev-001 --project-id proj-123

    # Get employee load across projects
    python employee_pool.py load

    # Suggest employee for a task
    python employee_pool.py suggest --capabilities "python,testing" --complexity standard

    # Get load balancing suggestions
    python employee_pool.py balance
