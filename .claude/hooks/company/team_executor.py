P84: Agent Teams Role Projection — Employee-Informed Multi-Agent Execution.

Integrates Claude Code's experimental Agent Teams feature as an optional
execution mode in the daemon. Uses Role Projection to map existing employee
identities onto teammates for inter-agent collaboration on complex tasks.

Architecture (ADR-004):
    - Role Projection: existing employees projected into team roles via
      agent definition + memory + role-scoped lens
    - Ephemeral gap-fill: meta-agent generates specialists when no employee matches
    - Feature-gated: disabled by default, requires dual opt-in
    - Falls back to single-agent if team execution fails

Usage:
    from team_executor import should_use_team, compose_team, execute_with_team

    if should_use_team(task, config):
        composition = compose_team(task, lead_employee_id, config)
        result = execute_with_team(task, composition, config, project_dir)
    else:
        # Standard single-agent execution
        result = activate_employee_for_task(task)

    Execute a task using Agent Teams with projected employee identities.

    Worktree isolation: team execution spawns MULTIPLE write-capable Claude
    agents, so it must NEVER run in the main repo root. The daemon supplies an
    isolated worktree via ``project_dir`` (operation_loop WS-092). When no
    ``project_dir`` is given (manual / non-daemon callers), this SELF-ISOLATES:
    it creates a throwaway worktree off main, runs the team there, harvests any
    changes to a branch+PR (reusing the single-agent ``_capture_code_changes``),
    and removes the worktree. If worktree creation fails — or an explicit
    ``project_dir`` resolves to the main repo root — it refuses rather than
    corrupting the working tree (the caller then falls back to single-agent).
