"""
Nightly coverage module for the Forge G1 (test coverage) goal pipeline.

Runs the project's full test suite with coverage once, deterministically,
and writes a trusted ``coverage.json`` at the project root -- the exact
file ``goal_tracker._read_trusted_coverage`` looks for. This replaces
letting an LLM worker session attempt a full-suite pytest run (which
cannot finish inside one session for a large suite and gets correctly
blocked by the deliverable gate three times, wasting a queue slot).

Design constraints:
- Scope matches the coverage config's source of truth (``.coveragerc`` /
  ``pyproject.toml [tool.coverage.run] source``), not CI's broader
  ``--cov=tests`` addition -- this keeps the measurement aligned with
  what ``goal_tracker._expected_measured_count`` treats as "the whole
  project" for its subset-run trust check.
- Takes the same ``.coverage.lock`` fcntl exclusive lock that
  ``assess_test_coverage``'s inline (non-lightweight) pytest runner
  uses, so this job can never race a daemon-triggered coverage run over
  the shared ``.coverage`` SQLite database (the WS-101 130GB-leak class).
- Injectable ``_runner`` for test isolation; never invokes ``subprocess``
  directly outside of it.
- Never raises for a coverage/test failure -- those are data, not fatal
  errors. Only I/O errors (company dir missing, lock unavailable within
  the wait) are fatal to the CLI.
