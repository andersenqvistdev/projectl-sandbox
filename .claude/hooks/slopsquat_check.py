PreToolUse Hook: Block slopsquatted/hallucinated packages before install runs.

Closes the gap in dependency_check.py (PostToolUse, warn-only, small typosquat
regex): that hook only fires AFTER npm/pip install has already completed, and
its list can't catch "slopsquatting" — attackers pre-registering package names
that LLMs are known to hallucinate. An agent (the daemon's normal mode is
unattended) that resolves an unfamiliar dependency without checking whether it
actually exists, or how recently it was registered, can install an
attacker-controlled payload before any post-install check runs.

This hook runs BEFORE the install command executes and, for each package being
installed:
  1. Checks a small offline typosquat regex list (fast path, no network) —
     the only BLOCK signal that never depends on the network.
  2. Looks the package up on the real registry (PyPI / npm) to confirm it
     exists — a nonexistent name on the DEFAULT public registry is either a
     harmless typo (which pip/npm would reject anyway) or a hallucinated name
     an attacker hasn't squatted yet; blocking forces the agent to re-plan
     with a clear message instead of proceeding blind.
  3. If the package exists, checks how long ago it was first published. A
     very new package matching a trending hallucination is a warning signal
     even though it's real.

Install forms recognized (each anchored at a command-segment start so a literal
"pip install ..." inside `echo`/heredoc DATA is not mistaken for an invocation):
pip / pip3 / pipx / pipenv install, uv pip install, uv add, poetry add, and the
`python[3] -m pip install` / `python -m uv ...` wrappers; npm install / npm i,
yarn add, pnpm add / pnpm install. Segments are split on `;`, `&`, `|`, and
unquoted newlines. Scoped npm packages (`@scope/name`) are extracted and
checked.

Registration note: `.claude/settings.json` is human-protected, so this module
has no PreToolUse entry of its own. `block_dangerous.py` (already registered
for the Bash matcher) imports and runs `check_command` after its own dangerous-
pattern and network-egress checks — the same piggyback pattern
network_egress_guard.py uses. The module stays fully unit-testable in isolation
(see tests/test_slopsquat_check.py) and its standalone `main()` below remains
usable for direct invocation.

Custom-registry safety: when an install carries a custom-index/registry flag
(`--index-url`/`-i`/`--extra-index-url` for pip, `--registry` for npm) the
package lives on a PRIVATE registry, not public PyPI/npm. Querying the public
registry for it would 404 and wrongly block a legitimate internal install — the
exact workflow enterprise users rely on. So the network lookups (existence +
age) are SKIPPED for such segments; only the offline typosquat regex still
applies (it's registry-independent).

Fail-open on network errors by design: if the registry can't be reached
(offline dev, registry outage, timeout, malformed response), the package is
skipped rather than blocked — inability to check is not a positive block
signal, and a PreToolUse hook that hangs or wrongly blocks on network hiccups
would break normal dev workflow. Existence/age findings are the signal;
network errors are not.

Security Profile Aware (see hook_config.py):
- strict/standard: BLOCK on typosquat matches and on nonexistent packages
  (default registry only); WARN on very-recently-registered real packages.
- minimal: disabled.
