# /efficiency — G6 Efficiency Report

Display efficiency metrics and optimization insights for the company.

## Input
$ARGUMENTS

Optional arguments:
- `--employee [id]` — Show individual employee efficiency analysis
- `--insights` — Show discovered patterns and recommendations
- `--optimize` — Run optimization analysis and apply learned patterns
- `--research` — Run comprehensive efficiency analysis session
- `--intervals` — Show adaptive intervals analysis and recommendations (P18)

---

## Step 0: Detect Company Mode

Use the company_resolver to find the company root:

```bash
# Find company root
uv run .claude/hooks/company/company_resolver.py find

# Check if in company mode
uv run .claude/hooks/company/company_resolver.py mode
```

Store the results:
- `company_root` — Path to company root
- `company_dir` — Path to `.company/` directory
- `is_company_mode` — Boolean indicating if company exists

### Check Company Exists

```bash
ls [company_dir]/org.json 2>/dev/null
```

**If not exists:**
```
No company initialized. Run /company-init or /company-bootstrap first.
```
Exit without further processing.

---

## Step 1: Gather Efficiency Data

Fetch efficiency data from the tracker:

```bash
# Get company efficiency report
uv run .claude/hooks/company/efficiency_tracker.py report

# Get memory hit rate statistics
uv run .claude/hooks/company/efficiency_tracker.py memory
```

Parse the JSON output and extract:
- `company_efficiency` — Overall company score and target
- `employee_breakdown` — Per-employee efficiency scores
- `patterns` — Discovered routing patterns
- `memory_stats` — Memory sharing effectiveness
- `learning` — Patterns discovered and optimizations applied
- `recommendations` — Improvement suggestions

Also read company metadata:
```bash
# Get company name from org.json
cat [company_dir]/org.json
```

Extract `company_name` from the organization config.

## Step 2: Render Efficiency Dashboard (Default, no flags)

Generate the ASCII dashboard with efficiency metrics:

```
===============================================================
  FORGE EFFICIENCY REPORT
  Generated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC | Company: [company_name]
===============================================================

[EFFICIENCY] Score: X.XX / Target: X.XX [efficiency_bar] ([status])

  Company Efficiency: X.XX (+/-X.XX vs target)
  Capacity Usage: XXX/XXXX units [capacity_bar] XX%
  Optimization Lift: +XX% since baseline

[TOP PERFORMERS]

## Step 3: Employee Analysis (`--employee [id]` flag)

If `--employee` flag is present with an employee ID:

```bash
# Get individual employee efficiency
uv run .claude/hooks/company/efficiency_tracker.py employee --employee-id [employee_id]
```

Show detailed employee view:

```
===============================================================

## Step 4: Insights View (`--insights` flag)

If `--insights` flag is present:

```bash
# Get efficiency insights
uv run .claude/hooks/company/efficiency_tracker.py insights
```

Show insights dashboard:

```
===============================================================
  FORGE EFFICIENCY INSIGHTS

[RECOMMENDATIONS] X suggestions
| Priority | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| High | Routing | Route [pattern] tasks to [employee] |
| Medium | Memory | Increase context reuse (XX% -> 70%) |
| High | Quality | Reduce escalation rate (XX% -> <10%) |

[TOP PERFORMERS] X employees
| Employee | Score | Tasks | Strengths |
|----------|-------|-------|-----------|
| [name] | X.XX | XX | [tags] |

[IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES]
  [For declining employees:]
  - [employee_name]: Showing declining efficiency - Review recent tasks

  [For underutilized employees:]
  - [employee_name]: High efficiency but low volume - Route more tasks

===============================================================
```

---

## Step 5: Optimization (`--optimize` flag)

If `--optimize` flag is present:

```bash
# Run optimization analysis
uv run .claude/hooks/company/efficiency_tracker.py optimize
```

Show optimization results:

```
===============================================================
  FORGE EFFICIENCY OPTIMIZATION
  Generated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC | Company: [company_name]
===============================================================

[ANALYSIS COMPLETE]
  Analyzed: XX task executions
  Time Window: Last 30 days

[PATTERNS DISCOVERED] X new patterns
| Pattern | Optimal Employee | Improvement |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| [tag] | [employee_id] | +XX% efficiency |

[OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED]
  - Routing patterns saved for future task allocation
  - Memory patterns indexed for context sharing

[NEXT STEPS]
  1. New tasks matching discovered patterns will be auto-routed
  2. Run /efficiency --insights to see current recommendations
  3. Monitor /efficiency regularly to track improvements

===============================================================
```

===============================================================
```

---

## Step 7: Handle Empty States

### No Task Executions
```
[EFFICIENCY] No data available
  No task executions recorded yet.
  Execute tasks to start tracking efficiency.
```

### No Employees
```
[EFFICIENCY] No employees
  No employees hired yet.
  Use /company-hire to add employees.
```

### Insufficient Data
```
[EFFICIENCY] Insufficient data
  Only XX task executions recorded.
  Need at least 5 executions for meaningful analysis.
```

### Employee Not Found
```
Employee '[id]' not found.
Available employees: [list of employee IDs]
```

---

## Step 8: Adaptive Intervals (`--intervals` flag)

If `--intervals` flag is present, show executive loop interval analysis:

```bash
# Get interval recommendation
uv run .claude/hooks/company/interval_learner.py recommend --current-interval 4.0

# Detect patterns from session history
uv run .claude/hooks/company/interval_learner.py patterns
```

Show adaptive intervals dashboard:

```
===============================================================
  FORGE ADAPTIVE INTERVALS
  Generated: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC | Company: [company_name]
===============================================================

[CURRENT SETTINGS]
  Interval: X.X hours
  Sessions Analyzed: XX
  Adaptive Mode: [Enabled/Disabled]

[RECOMMENDATION]
  Suggested Interval: X.X hours
  Confidence: XX% [confidence_bar]
  Expected Savings: XX%
  Auto-Apply: [Yes/No]

  Reasoning: [recommendation_reasoning]

[DETECTED PATTERNS] X patterns

| Pattern | Description | Confidence |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| queue_state | Empty queue sessions avg X.XX value | XX% |
| time_of_day | Peak hour: XX:00 (avg X.XX) | XX% |

[SESSION VALUE DISTRIBUTION]
  High value (>0.7): XX sessions
  Medium (0.3-0.7): XX sessions
  Low value (<0.3): XX sessions

[HOW TO APPLY]
  To apply the recommended interval:
  1. Update forge-config.json:
     "executiveLoop": {
       "intervalHours": X.X
     }
  2. Restart daemon: /daemon restart

  To enable auto-apply:
  1. Set in forge-config.json:
     "executiveLoop": {
       "adaptiveIntervals": {
         "enabled": true,
         "autoApplyThreshold": 0.8
       }
     }

===============================================================
```

### Interval Scoring

The `--intervals --score-session [id]` subcommand shows scoring for a specific session:

```bash
# Score a specific session
uv run .claude/hooks/company/interval_learner.py score --session-id "2026-02-27T10:00:00Z"

# Score raw session data
uv run .claude/hooks/company/interval_learner.py score-raw --session '{"work_submitted": 2, "decisions_count": 1, "queue_pending_at_start": 0}'
```

Output:
```
[SESSION SCORE]
  Session ID: 2026-02-27T10:00:00Z
  Value Score: X.XX / 1.00

  [FACTORS]
  | Factor | Value | Score |
  |--------|-------|-------|
  | Work Submitted | X | 0.50 |
  | Decisions Made | X | 0.30 |
  | Queue Empty | [Yes/No] | 0.20 |
  | High Queue Penalty | [Yes/No] | -0.20 |

  [FORMULA]
  value = 0.5*(work>0) + 0.3*(decisions>0) + 0.2*(queue_empty)
  penalty = -0.2 if queue > 5
```

## Rules

- **Always fetch fresh data.** Don't cache between invocations.
- **Parse JSON carefully.** Handle missing fields gracefully with defaults.
- **Respect flags.** If a specific flag is passed, show ONLY that section with more detail.
- **Use ASCII art consistently.** Box-drawing characters for borders, block characters for bars.
- **Handle errors gracefully.** If a data source fails, show "Data unavailable" for that section.
- **Include generation timestamp.** Always show when the report was generated.
- **Quick operation.** This should complete in under 2 seconds for typical use.
- **Focus on actionable insights.** Highlight what can be improved, not just metrics.
- **Show trends.** Use arrows and status to indicate direction of change.
