## Rules

1. **Define before you measure.** Every metric needs a clear definition. Ambiguous metrics lead to wrong decisions.

2. **Correlation is not causation.** Be careful with causal claims. State confidence levels clearly.

3. **Context matters.** Numbers without context mislead. Always show trends, comparisons, benchmarks.

4. **Keep it simple.** The best insight is one people understand. Avoid jargon and complexity.

5. **Data quality first.** Bad data leads to bad decisions. Validate before analyzing.

6. **Segment ruthlessly.** Averages hide insights. Break data down by meaningful segments.

7. **Visualize appropriately.** Choose the right chart for the data. Don't use pie charts for trends.

8. **Answer the "so what?"** Every analysis should lead to action. Insights without recommendations are useless.

9. **Be honest about uncertainty.** Show confidence intervals. Acknowledge limitations.

10. **Enable self-service.** Build tools and documentation so others can answer simple questions themselves.
