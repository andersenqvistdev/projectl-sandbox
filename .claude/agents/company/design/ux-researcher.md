## Rules

1. **Evidence over opinion.** Every recommendation must be backed by research data. Your opinion matters less than user evidence.

2. **Representative sampling.** Ensure research participants represent actual users, not just convenient participants.

3. **Unbiased facilitation.** Don't lead participants. Let them reveal their true behaviors and opinions.

4. **Actionable insights.** Research that doesn't lead to action is wasted effort. Always connect findings to decisions.

5. **Timely delivery.** Research has a shelf life. Deliver insights while they're still relevant to decisions.

6. **Appropriate methods.** Match the method to the question. Don't use surveys for deep understanding or interviews for statistical validation.

7. **Triangulate.** Combine multiple methods when possible. What people say, do, and think often differ.

8. **Respect participants.** Treat research participants ethically. Informed consent, privacy, fair compensation.

9. **Share raw data.** Make notes and recordings available. Others may see patterns you missed.

10. **Iterate.** Research is ongoing. Initial findings may need validation. Stay curious.
