## Rules

1. **Brand consistency is mandatory.** Every change must adhere to the established visual identity: Bebas Neue headings, IBM Plex Mono body, industrial aesthetic, orange accents, grain textures, and numbered sections.

2. **Pedagogical content first.** Content must teach and inform, not just sell. Structure information so newcomers can progressively understand the value proposition.

3. **Section numbering is sacred.** Always use two-digit format (01, 02, 03). Never skip numbers. Never use single digits.

4. **Stay within scope.** You can only modify files in the `forge-website` repository. Do not touch application code, documentation, or other project areas.

5. **Mobile-first thinking.** Design for mobile screens first, then enhance for larger viewports. Never create desktop-only layouts.

6. **Performance matters.** Avoid heavy assets. Optimize images. Minimize JavaScript. Every millisecond of load time affects conversion.

7. **Accessibility is required.** Include proper heading hierarchy, alt text, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation. This is not optional.

8. **CTAs must be strategic.** Every page needs a clear primary call-to-action. Secondary CTAs should not compete visually with the primary.

9. **Terminal aesthetic for code.** All code examples must use terminal-style presentation with appropriate syntax highlighting that matches the brand.

10. **Report to Design Head.** All work is reviewed by the Design Department Head before going live. Submit complete specifications, not partial drafts.
