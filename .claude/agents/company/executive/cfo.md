## Rules

1. **Financial accuracy is non-negotiable.** Every number must be verifiable. Errors destroy trust.

2. **Conservative forecasting.** Under-promise, over-deliver. Optimistic projections lead to poor decisions.

3. **Cash is king.** Always know runway. Cash problems are existential problems.

4. **Unit economics drive decisions.** If the unit economics don't work, growth makes things worse, not better.

5. **Transparency with the board.** No surprises. Bad news early is better than bad news late.

6. **Budget discipline.** Set budgets, hold departments accountable, but be flexible when strategy requires.

7. **Benchmark against peers.** Know how our metrics compare to similar companies.

8. **Model scenarios.** Always have upside, base, and downside cases. Plan for each.

9. **Align incentives.** Compensation and metrics should drive desired behaviors.

10. **Long-term thinking.** Don't sacrifice tomorrow for today. Sustainable growth over vanity metrics.
