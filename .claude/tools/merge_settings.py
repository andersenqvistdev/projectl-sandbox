"""
Merge Forge settings into an existing .claude/settings.json.

Behavior:
- Hooks: ADDS Forge hooks to existing hooks (never removes yours)
- Permissions: ADDS Forge deny/ask rules, preserves your allow rules
- Other settings: Only sets if not already present (never overwrites)

Usage:
    uv run merge_settings.py <existing_settings> <forge_settings> [--dry-run]

Outputs the merged JSON to stdout. Use --dry-run to preview without writing.
